# Python package needed:

* import random
* from prettytable import PrettyTable
* from pythonds.basic.queue import Queue
* import time
* from pythonds.basic.deque import Deque

# Run notebooks
If you want to run these notebooks but without installing jupyter on your machine you can use Google Colab.
